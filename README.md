This mod allows hosting an HTTP server on Minecraft. Both running on the same port as the Minecraft server and using a separate one are supported.  
It also acts as a kind of reverse-proxy, allowing routing between different handlers based on the requested path or domain.

## Usage
### Players
Download the mod from Modrinth and follow the [documentation](https://mesh-lib.docs.offsetmonkey538.top/).

### Mod Devs
There's a maven repository at https://maven.offsetmonkey538.top/releases and Javadoc is available [here](https://maven.offsetmonkey538.top/javadoc/releases/top/offsetmonkey538/meshlib/meshlib-common/latest)...  
How to use it? Well uhh... yeah IDK look at how I use it in Git Pack Manager if you really want to.
